# Lock, Stock and Two Smoke Simulations

A semi-Lagrangian smoke simulation based on the paper [Visual Simulation of Smoke, written by Jos Stam et al](http://graphics.ucsd.edu/~henrik/papers/smoke/smoke.pdf). It is developed in CLion and rendered in Houdini. Partio is used. Bouyancy, gravity and vorticity are implemented. Youtube link is [here](https://youtu.be/aRtN3Ayun0E
